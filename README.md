# Neo-Asteroids-Server

This project is a web application that allows users to view the statistics of Near Earth Objects (NEO) by fetching data from NASA’s NeoWs API. Users can input a date range and view the number of asteroids passing near Earth on each day within that range. The app also displays additional information such as the fastest asteroid, the closest asteroid, and the average size of the asteroids.

### Features
Date Selection: Users can choose a start and end date to fetch asteroid data.
Asteroid Statistics: Displays the number of asteroids for each day within the date range.
Fastest Asteroid: Shows the fastest asteroid in km/h.
Closest Asteroid: Displays the closest asteroid during the date range.
Average Asteroid Size: Provides the average size of the asteroids in kilometers.
Chart Visualization: Uses Chart.js to display a line chart of asteroid statistics.
